<h2><a name="A_BUNCH_OF_KEYS" id="A_BUNCH_OF_KEYS">A BUNCH OF KEYS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> a professional man, and reside in the West
End of London. One morning some few months
back, my assistant on coming to attend to his
duties produced a bunch of keys, which he informed
me he had just picked up at the corner of
a street leading from Oxford Street.</p>

<p>'Hadn't they best be handed over to the
police?' suggested my assistant. I wish to goodness
I had at once closed with his suggestion; but
I didn't, much to my own cost, as will be presently
seen.</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know,' was my answer. 'I rather
think it will be a wiser plan to advertise them, if
the owner is really to have a chance of recovering
them; for to my mind, articles found in that way
and handed over to the police are rarely heard of
again.'</p>

<p>An advertisement for the <i>Times</i> was duly drawn
up and sent off for insertion. It merely stated
where the keys had been picked up, and where
the owner of the bunch could have it returned to
him on giving a proper description. The next
morning the advertisement appeared; and though
I half expected that some applications might be
made later on in the same day, it passed over
quite quietly. But the following morning I had a
foretaste of the trouble that awaited me so soon as
the postman had deposited my letters in the box
and given his accustomed knock. A glance at my
table shewed me that my correspondence was very
considerably beyond its average that morning. The
very first letter I opened was in reference to the
advertisement; and before I had gone through the
collection I found there were over twenty applications
for the bunch of keys in my possession.
Some of the writers took the trouble to describe
the keys they had lost; but none of them were in
the least like those that had been picked up by
my assistant. Some did not take the trouble to
give any description at all, or to state if they had
been in the part of the town where the keys were
found; and a few boldly claimed them on the
strength of having dropped a bunch miles from
the spot indicated in the advertisement!</p>

<p>By the time I had got through my letters and
my breakfast, my servant came to tell me that
my waiting-room was already full of people&mdash;'mostly
ladies,' he said&mdash;though it was nearly two
hours before the time I was accustomed to see any
one professionally. With a foreboding that a good
deal of worry and a loss of much valuable time
was in store for me, I entered my consulting-room,
and gave orders that the ladies should be admitted
in the order of their arrival. They were all applicants
for the keys; and out of the sixteen
persons that were waiting, fourteen were ladies.
The two gentlemen were soon despatched. They
<i>had</i> lost keys, near the spot for anything they
could tell; but on being satisfied that what had
been found did in no way agree with the description
of what they had lost, they apologised for the
trouble and went at once.</p>

<p>But it was no such easy matter to get rid of my
fourteen lady-applicants. Some of them were for
inflicting upon me a narration of family affairs that
had not the most remote connection with the business
in hand. A few kept closely enough to the
subject on which they had come; but would not
take a denial that the keys in my possession were
not the least like those they said they had lost;
and it was only at the sacrifice of some of my
usual politeness that I was able to get rid of them.
Not one of the morning's arrival could make out
anything like a fair claim, and one or two owned
that they had not even been in the quarter where
the keys were found on the day specified.</p>

<p>More letters, more applicants, came as the day
wore on; and I began heartily to repent of my
well-meant desire to benefit my fellow-mortals by
taking the trouble to find out the rightful owner of
a lost article. I was just on the point of giving
orders to my servant to put off all further applicants
until the following morning, when he ushered
in a comfortable-looking lady of middle age, who
proceeded straight to business by at once describing
with the greatest accuracy the bunch of keys
that had given me so much anxiety that day; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">{786}</a></span>
assuring me that she had passed the spot indicated
in the advertisement on the morning they were
found.</p>

<p>'Nine keys on the bunch, all Chubb's patent;
three very small ones, five of various sizes, and one
latch-key longer than any of the others.'</p>

<p>The description was perfect. Some of the other
applicants had curiously enough been right as to
the number, but wrong as to description.</p>

<p>I at once told my lady visitor that I had no
doubt the keys were hers; and that I was ready to
hand them over to her. But I ventured to add
that it would give me greater security were she to
permit my assistant to accompany her to her residence,
and there, in his presence, to open the
different locks to which the keys belonged. To
this proposal not the smallest objection was raised.
She begged I would call my assistant, as she had a
cab waiting at the door. The direction was given
to some place in Bloomsbury, and they drove off.
In less than an hour my assistant returned. He
stated that the lady opened the street door with the
latch-key, and that the other eight keys opened
desks, writing-tables, cash-boxes, &amp;c.&mdash;all quite
correct and satisfactorily. The expense of the
advertisement was of course paid.</p>

<p>Congratulating myself that this troublesome
business was well over, and mentally resolving
that another time, under similar circumstances, I
should act on my assistant's suggestion, and hand
such matters over to the police, I gave orders that
all applicants that might come were to be told
that the rightful owner had been found and that
the keys were disposed of.</p>

<p>Two days passed, and I had almost dismissed
the whole affair from my mind. On the morning
of the third day my attention was attracted by an
altercation going on between my servant and an
irate lady&mdash;well advanced in years&mdash;to whom he
refused admittance. Anxious to escape disturbance,
I gave orders that she should be shewn into my
consulting-room, where I presently went to see
what she wanted.</p>

<p>'I want to know why you never answered my
letter about the bunch of keys you advertised as
having found, and which I lost? I have come for
them now.'</p>

<p>'But, madam, none of the letters described the
keys accurately, and I was therefore not bound
to notice any of the written applications that
reached me.'</p>

<p>'Not describe them properly! But I <i>can</i> describe
them; they were nine in number on the bunch.'</p>

<p>'So far, that is right, madam. Proceed with
your description.'</p>

<p>The description was entirely wrong; and I told
her so. I told her, moreover, that the rightful
owner had been found, who had not only described
the keys properly, but who had taken my assistant
to her house and had used each individual key
in his presence. I added that if she were not
satisfied, I could furnish her with the address of
the lady to whom the keys had been given up,
and that she might call and try to establish her
claim if she fancied she had one.</p>

<p>She was very far from being satisfied. She
wanted to argue the matter further and, as I feared,
to an unreasonable length. I told her firmly I
could waste no further time on her; whereupon
she left vowing vengeance.</p>

<p>The threats of the old lady did not much disturb
me; but they were not altogether so unmeaning as
I supposed, for in two days thereafter a summons
was handed into me, demanding my presence at
the police court of the district, to answer for my
refusal to deliver up to the rightful owner property
belonging to her, which I owned to having
found, but refused to account for.</p>

<p>That I was very much annoyed may be easily
supposed; but at the same time I could not help
being somewhat amused, bearing in recollection
how I had tried to satisfy the unreasonable
dame, who had evidently more money than wit,
seeing she was ready to waste it on so hopeless
a case.</p>

<p>I duly made my appearance before the worthy
magistrate, whom I happened to know slightly,
and who could not restrain an amused grin when
I was called forward. My assistant accompanied
me as a matter of course.</p>

<p>The old lady had engaged a smart lawyer, who
did his best in trying to make out a case; but his
client rather weakened his statement by her inconsequential
answers to both her counsel and the
magistrate. My answer was easy. I shewed how
the prosecutrix had utterly failed in describing
the keys. I told that the rightful owner had
rightly described them; and I put my assistant
into the box to prove his having seen every key
in the bunch fitted into its proper lock.</p>

<p>'Were you passing along Oxford Street on the
morning that this bunch of keys was found?'
asked the magistrate of the old lady.</p>

<p>'I was that way in an omnibus in the afternoon,'
was the answer.</p>

<p>'But the keys in question were found in the
morning, and were lying on the pavement,' remarked
His Worship.</p>

<p>'Ah, I don't know how that might be,' said my
persecutor; 'but I know I lost a bunch of keys.'</p>

<p>'Well, the case is dismissed; and you must
pay expenses.' And so ended the case.</p>

<p>Now I have no doubt the old lady, though so
wrong-headed in the claim she set up against me,
had really lost a bunch of keys on the day my
assistant made his&mdash;for me&mdash;unlucky find. Nor
do I for a moment doubt the fact of some of the
other applicants having also lost keys on the same
day and perhaps near the same spot. But the
applications by letter and personally numbered
altogether not far short of fifty; and it may be set
down as a moral certainty that they did not all
lose, each of them, a bunch of keys on that particular
day, and in Oxford Street&mdash;without being
particular as to the spot. My theory is, that some
of them had probably got their pockets picked of
their keys while travelling by omnibus, and could
not of course tell exactly where they lost them.
Others may have simply mislaid their keys, and
jumped to the conclusion that they were lost.
Some others, I fear, had not lost keys at all, but
merely came to my place out of idle curiosity.
All of them, I know, gave me more trouble
than I ever hope to have again in an affair of
the kind.</p>

<p>[We can hardly say that the foregoing narrative,
to call it so, is overstrained. It points to a marvellous
want of logical precision in reasoning
which is far from uncommon. Some years ago,
in these pages, we mentioned a droll case within
our own experience. One day we chanced to find a
brooch, and advertised the fact in the newspapers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">{787}</a></span>
Next day a lady called on us to say that she had
lost a ring, and asked if we knew anything about
it. 'Madam,' was our reply, 'you must understand
that it was a brooch we found, and not a
ring.' 'O yes, that maybe so; but I thought as
you were in the way of finding things, you might
perhaps have seen something of my ring.' A
very pretty example this of want of common-sense.
Our advice to all who happen to find any
article of value on the street is, to take it at once
to the police office, where it may be reclaimed by
the owner. Those who will not take this trouble,
should let the article alone. Finding does not
constitute ownership. We knew a gentleman, now
deceased, who in the course of his life punctiliously
refrained from picking up any article of value on
the street, as the article was not his, and he might
have been brought into trouble. This was being
too fastidious, for it was allowing the article to be
appropriated by possibly some dishonest person.
True kindness and true honesty consist in lodging
the article found, at the police office, whence, if no
owner casts up within twelve months, it will be
sent to the finder, whose lawful property it
becomes.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAND_OF_THE_INCAS" id="THE_LAND_OF_THE_INCAS">THE LAND OF THE INCAS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Peru</span> recalls to every thoughtful student of history
not only the half-barbaric splendour of the empire
of the Incas, but the vanished prestige and glory of
their Spanish conquerors. The gorgeous figure of
Pizarro, the stately hidalgo, the successful captain,
the ruthless soldier of fortune, meets us still at
every step in the once rich Indian empire he won
for Spain. On that low swampy mangrove-fringed
stretch of coast, a tangled maze of vines and flowering
creepers, the half-famished Castilian adventurer
landed in 1524. And here, where the full tide of
the Pacific rolls in upon the beach in columns of
snowy foam, he, in 1535, founded Lima, the 'city
of the kings.'</p>

<p>To examine the cities of the Incas, their
ruined palaces, and other objects of note in this
interesting region, was a task undertaken and
carried out by Mr Squier, whose researches have
been embodied in a volume entitled the <i>Land of
the Incas</i>, the perusal of which enables us to offer
the following items to our readers.</p>

<p>The coast of Peru is arid and barren, lined with
guano islands, which although adding little to the
charm of the scenery, are found as lucrative to-day
as the mines of Potosi and Pasco were in the heyday
of Spanish greatness. Thanks to this useful but
unfragrant compost, Pizarro's city of the kings
is still rich and flourishing, though the veins of
silver are exhausted, and the golden sands no
longer glitter with the precious ore, which fired the
Spanish breasts of old with such fierce cupidity. It
is very unhealthy, and although in the tropics, the
climate for six months in the year is extremely
damp and almost cold. Lima, which stands in
an earthquake region, is built so as to sustain the
least possible damage from the ever recurring
shocks of those alarming phenomena. The private
houses are never more than two stories in height.
They have flat roofs and projecting balconies, and
are constructed (one can hardly say built) of cane,
plastered with mud, and painted in imitation of
stone. Most of them have courts with open galleries
in the Moorish style, extending along the
four sides; and many of them have towers, from
which, in addition to the surrounding scenery, an
extended view of acres of flat roofs may be obtained&mdash;the
said flat roofs being piled with heaps of
refuse, filth, and all manner of abominations; very
often they are used as poultry-yards, and here
the buzzards, which act as scavengers in all the
South American cities, roost at night.</p>

<p>The furniture in the better class of these wicker
and mud-built dwellings is often very fine: antique
plate, velvet hangings, costly mirrors, and family
portraits, that smile or frown upon you with all
the charm or vigour the brush of Vandyke or
Velasquez was able to impart. The <i>pasios</i> or
public walks are planted with trees, and the
arcades, which are lined with fine shops, are a very
favourite promenade. The inhabitants of Lima
of all grades are remarkably fond of flowers, particularly
of roses, which they contrive to keep in
bloom all the year round. 'Roses,' Mr Squier
says, 'bloom in every court and blush on every
balcony, and decorate alike the heavy tresses of the
belle and the curly shock of the zamba.'</p>

<p>Bull-fights are a favourite amusement, and so is
cock-fighting, although it is no longer, as formerly,
practised in the public streets.</p>

<p>The markets are well supplied, especially with
fruit and vegetables. Fish is good and the butcher-meat
of fair quality. The luckless traveller in
Central America who could get nothing but
chickens and turkeys to eat, and was afraid at last
that his whiskers would transform themselves into
feathers, may go to Lima with all safety, as a
medium-sized turkey there costs twenty dollars
in gold. The cookery is Spanish in its character,
and consists much of stews savoury with oil and
garlic and pungent with red pepper.</p>

<p>Twenty miles from Lima is Pachacamac, a sacred
city of the Incas, where once stood a gigantic
temple, dedicated to a deity of the same name, the
supreme creator and preserver of the universe.
The ruins of two large wings of this temple still
remain, one of which contains a perfect well-turned
arch, which is so rare a feature in American
ruins that Mr Squier says 'it is the only proper
arch I ever found in all my explorations in Central
and South America.' Pachacamac was the Mecca
of South America; and its barren hills and dry
nitrous sand-heaps are filled with the dead bodies
of ancient pilgrims, who travelled from all parts of
the country to lay their bones, not their dust, in
this hallowed spot. 'Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,'
has no meaning here; the dead body does not decay,
but is dried and shrivelled into a mummy. Mr
Squier had the curiosity to open the shroud of
what may once have been perchance an Aztec belle.
The body, which was that of a young girl, was in a
sitting posture, supported on a workbox of braided
reeds, in which were rude specimens of knitting,
spindles for weaving, spools of thread, needles of
bone and bronze, a small bronze knife, a fan, and
a set of curious cosmetic-boxes formed of the
hollow bones of a bird. These were filled with
pigments of various colours, and were carefully
stopped with cotton. Beside them was a small
powder-puff of cotton for applying them to the
face, and a rude mirror formed of a piece of iron
pyrites highly polished. There was also a netting
instrument and a little crushed ornament of gold
intended to represent a butterfly. The long black
hair, still glossy as in life, was braided and plaited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">{788}</a></span>
round the forehead, which was bound with a fillet
of white cloth adorned with silver spangles. A
silver bracelet hung on the shrunken arm; and
between the feet was the dried body of a dead
parrot, a pet no doubt in life, and sacrificed to bear
its mistress company into the dread unknown land
of spirits.</p>

<p>In the fertile valley of Canete, amid rich sugar-plantations,
Mr Squier found vast pyramidal
buildings, rising stage upon stage, with broad
flights of steps winding round them to the summits.
While sketching amid a maze of these
massive shattered adobe walls, our author was
startled by seeing three men suddenly leap over
a low wall into the vivid sunshine before him.
'God and peace be with you!' he said as calmly as
he could, instinctively divining that his best cue
was to appear as cool as possible. 'God and
peace be with you!' responded the bandits, for such
they were; and after a little bullying, an amicable
parley ensued, which had for its object the acquisition
of Mr Squier's breech-loading rifle, a weapon
which kindled in the bosom of Rossi Arci, the
robber chief, an ardent, but with all due deference
to Mr Longfellow, a wasted affection, for he did
not obtain it. Four weeks afterwards, Mr Squier
saw the swollen disfigured corpse of this bandit
captain exposed to public view in one of the
principal streets of Lima.</p>

<p>At Truxillo our author came across a treasure-hunter,
one Colonel La Rosa. This man spent
his whole life in burrowing like a mole among
the old ruins in search of buried gold, gems, silver
goblets, or any other relic of antiquity which
he could turn into money. Under his guidance,
Mr Squier visited a great pyramid called the
Temple of the Sun, and the extensive, interesting,
and well preserved ruins of Grand Chimu. Here
he found vast halls, the walls of which were
covered with arabesques, and wide corridors from
which spacious rooms diverged. The walls of these
apartments were bright with vivid and delicate
colours; and Colonel La Rosa shewed him where
in the midst of them he had found a walled-up
closet filled with vessels of gold and silver placed
in regular layers one above the other, as if they
had been hidden there in some dire emergency.
Two vaults were also discovered filled with silver
cups and goblets. The silver of which these
vessels were composed was much alloyed with
copper, and was so much oxidised that it had
become exceedingly brittle. Mr Squier obtained
possession of two of the cups. They have the
appearance of being hammered out of a single
piece of metal, are as thick as ordinary tin-plate,
and are both adorned by the representation of a
human face, with clearly cut features and a large
aquiline nose.</p>

<p>About a hundred yards to the westward of the
excavations which have revealed the half-buried
palace of the ancient princes of Chimu, is a low
broad mound, which has been found to be a
necropolis, filled with bodies richly clad and
covered with gold and silver ornaments. Many of
the heads of the dead bodies found by Colonel La
Rosa were gilt and encircled by bands of gold; and
one body, that of a woman, was covered with thin
sheets of gold, and wrapped in a robe spangled
with silver fishes. Warlike weapons and agricultural
implements, knives, war-clubs, lance-heads,
and spear-points, with spades and mattocks
of different shapes, all of bronze, are found abundantly
in the vicinity of these ruins; as are also
specimens of excellent pottery, on which are
modelled with spirit and fidelity representations
of birds, animals, fishes, shells, fruit, vegetables,
and the human face and form.</p>

<p>Leaving Chimu reluctantly, Mr Squier travelled
down to the coast, along which he sailed, examining
the coast ruins at Calaveras and other places,
till he reached Arica, the port of Tacna.</p>

<p>This is peculiarly an earthquake region; and
some of these subterranean convulsions are terrible
to a degree which we dwellers in a temperate
clime can scarcely even imagine. A notably dreadful
and destructive earthquake was that of 1868,
which shook to its base all the adjacent country.
It was first noted in Arica about five o'clock in
the morning, its premonitory symptoms being
immense clouds of dust, which were seen slowly
advancing across the plain in dusky columns at a
distance of about ten miles.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer they came; and in the awful
pause of dread expectancy that ensued, the distant
snowy peaks of the Cordilleras were observed to
nod and reel, as if executing some horribly suggestive
cyclopean dance. Gradually this impulse
extended itself to the mountains nearer to the
town, till the huge <i>morro</i> or headland, a little to
the left of it, began to rock violently to and fro,
heaving with sickening lurches, as if about to cast
itself loose into space, and always bringing to again,
like a hard bestead ship in a driving tempest.
As it worked back and forward, huge fragments
of stone detached themselves from its cave-worn
surface, and fell with deafening crash into the surf
below; while under and above all, like a subdued
monotone of horror, was a prolonged incessant
rumble, now like the roll of distant thunder, but
ever and anon at irregular intervals swelling into
a deafening crash, like the discharge of a whole
park of artillery.</p>

<p>As far as could be seen, the usually solid
earth was agitated by a slow wave-like motion,
which became first tremulous, and then unspeakably
violent, throwing half of the houses into
heaps of ruins, and yawning into wide chasm-like
fissures, from which mephitic sulphurous
vapours issued. Shrieks and groans of anguish
filled the air, a mournful interlude shrilly resounding
at intervals above the subterranean thunder, as
the terrified crowd rushed to the mole, to seek
refuge on board the vessels in the harbour. Scarcely
had they reached this hoped-for haven of safety,
when the sea, treacherous as the heaving land,
glided softly back, and then rushing forward with
a terrific roar, submerged the mole with its panting
terror-stricken occupants, and poured on in a foaming
flood over the prostrate town, where it completed
the havoc the earthquake had begun. It then
rushed back almost more suddenly than it had
advanced, the whole fearful deluge occupying only
about five minutes. Again and again the earth
quivered and shook, as if about to rend asunder
and drop into some unfathomable abyss below, and
again the sea dashed forward as if in frantic fury,
and then as suddenly recoiled, the last time shewing
a perpendicular wall of water forty-five feet
high, capped by an angry crest of foam. This
tremendous wave swept miles inshore, where it
stranded the largest ships then lying in the harbour,
one of them a United States frigate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">{789}</a></span></p>

<p>In Arica Mr Squier equipped himself for a
journey over the Cordilleras. Nothing can exceed
the savage wildness of these mountains, or the
difficulties and dangers of the long narrow passes
that intersect them. Mr Squier says: 'I have
crossed the Alps by the routes of the Simplon,
the Grand St Bernard, and St Gothard; but at
no point on any of them have I witnessed a
scene so wild and utterly desolate as that which
spreads out around La Portada.' It is the very acmé
of desolation&mdash;treeless, shrubless, bare of grass,
with scarcely a lichen clinging to the rugged
sides of the huge cliffs. Pile upon pile towering
to the sullen skies, rise ridges of dark-brown
hills bristling with snowy peaks, from several
of which long trails of smoke stream lazily out
upon the air, shewing where the pent volcano
surges in ominous life beneath the wintry wastes
of snow.</p>

<p>Descending from the Cordilleras, Mr Squier
examined Tiaguanuco, the Baalbec of the New
World; and from thence proceeded to Cuzco, the
City of the Sun, the ancient capital of the Incas,
which abounds with memorials of their vanished
greatness. Here stood a magnificent temple of the
sun, which was lined throughout with plates of
gold, two of which, preserved as curiosities, were
shewn to Mr Squier. The huge stones composing
this and other massive buildings which yet remain
are cut and fitted together with a precision which
has been equalled, but never surpassed. So accurately
do they fit, that it is impossible to pass the
finest-bladed knife between their edges.</p>

<p>In close proximity to these splendid ruins,
sometimes under their very walls, our author
found rude circles of stone, such as still exist
at Stonehenge and in other parts of Great Britain,
and in Brittany. Bidding adieu to Cuzco and its
suggestive relics, Mr Squier in his journey to the
coast passed over a stupendously high swinging
bridge formed of cables of braided withes. This
dreadful rope-edifice swung freely in space between
two gigantic cliffs, which guarded like twin sentinels
the rush of the deep and rapid Apurimac, one
of the head-waters of the Amazon. It was something
worse than the most breakneck defile among
the Cordilleras. 'Never,' says our author, 'will I
forget this experience. I can see still the frail
structure swaying at dizzy height over a dark
abyss filled with the deep hoarse roar of the river.
My eyes grew dim, my heart faint, my feet unsteady
as I struggled across, not daring to cast a
look on either hand.' It was no wonder that the
nerves of one of the party, an artist, were so
shaken that he declared that rather than set a
foot upon it, he would swim across the Apurimac.
This he did, and found the water so delightfully
cool and pleasant, that he resolved to prolong his
bath, and placed the bundle containing his clothes
and shoes on a convenient cliff, whence a perverse
gust of wind blew them into the water. Long he
pursued them, with no result except the conviction
that he had lost them irrecoverably and his way
as well. In this condition, foodless, garmentless,
he wandered about for three days in pathless
thickets. His feet were cut and bleeding; and his
body, scratched and torn, was scorched all day by
a blistering sun, and so chilled at night by the
cold breezes that he was glad to bury himself in
the warm sand. On the fourth day he staggered,
faint with fatigue and hunger, to the door of an
Indian hut, and the inhabitants mistaking him in
his ghastly squalor for the incarnate genius of
fever, which they dread above all things, half
killed with stones what little life was left in him
before they would listen to his story.</p>

<p>Mr Squier's researches abundantly shew that,
possessing no written language, the Incas have
impressed their history in characters which yet
remain upon the scenes of their former glory.
Their greatness may be traced in the splendid
ruins of their temples and palaces. Their civilisation
is abundantly proved by their bridges, roads,
caravansaries, reservoirs, aqueducts, and perfect
and extensive system of irrigation, by means of
which vegetation was carried in terraces thousands
of feet up the steep hill-sides, and the now desert
coast blushed like a garden with the profuse luxuriance
of the tropics. One may well ask, which
were the barbarians, they or the Spaniards who
soon made a Sahara of that which they found a
Goshen? Their great fortresses bristling on every
hill-side teach us alike the vastness of their military
power and their great resources. Of their
internal polity we catch a suggestive glimpse from
their ample prisons; and we learn how they lived
as we turn over curiously their household and
agricultural implements, or mark with mute surprise
the exquisitely fine texture of some mummy
shroud, or the delicate carving on some long-buried
goblet, or the graceful form and excellent workmanship
of some fragile relic of earthenware. We
can even make a guess, as we look at their burial
towers and tombs, at the current of national
thought on one important subject. They who
laid the dead so carefully, so tenderly to rest,
believed that in the far-off world of shadows the
soul would live again.</p>

<p class='ph3'>THE STORY OF A DETECTIVE OFFICER.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was nothing for me to do, that I could see,
for a day or two, beyond improving my acquaintance
with the factory hands, and keeping my eyes
open generally; and in pursuance of this latter
branch of the business, I got up very early on the
following morning, and sat for an hour or two after
daylight in the arbours or boxes I have so often
mentioned. There was one great charm about the
<i>Anchor</i>. It was low and dirty, decaying and disreputable,
and the landlord was a drinking fellow,
utterly bankrupt and hopeless, who troubled himself
about nothing. His potman was sottish also,
and too accustomed to riff-raff and queer doings of
every kind to trouble himself about me; so I was
thoroughly at my ease. All I saw which appeared
worthy of notice was that the ill-tempered ferryman
rowed out alone to the ship I have spoken
of, and disappeared round its bows. I watched for
some time, but did not see him come out into midstream;
but just before I gave up my watch, he
came into sight again. Whether he had crossed
after rowing up a bit and had come back, or
whether he had been lying all the time just hidden
by the ship, of course I could not say.</p>

<p>I had told the potman that I was in hope of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">{790}</a></span>
seeing a friend of mine who was going to Australia
and had half promised to take me with him.
I consequently shewed a great deal of interest in
the craft, and asked him lots of questions about
them. This morning I guessed that the ship (the
ferryman's ship), was an Australian liner; and this
was just the joke for the potman, who laughed till
his beery cheeks shook again at my mistaking a
slow old Dutch trader for an Australian liner.
He was quite severe in his way of poking fun at
me; but he ought to have pitied my ignorance, not
ridiculed it&mdash;and so I told him.</p>

<p>I thought I would pass away the morning by
going over to T&mdash;&mdash; and watching Mr Byrle's
house. I had learnt that he was to be from home
all day; Miss Doyle had told me so herself; so I
knew <i>she</i> knew it also; and if she had any suspicious
visits to pay, or queer company to receive,
now was the time: that was evident. Accordingly,
I went to T&mdash;&mdash; by rail as before, starting
in the rain; but luckily, just as I got there it
cleared up and the sun came out. To give me a
chance of learning something, I got asking my way
to a lot of places I didn't want to go to, just by
way of starting a conversation, you know; and the
man I pitched upon was employed in the goods
shed of the railway, but did not seem to have
much to do just then; and when I asked him if he
could spare time to run across to the public-house
with me, he said yes, he thought he could; and
he did.</p>

<p>We could see Mr Byrle's house from this place,
so it answered as well for me as any other; and
while I was talking to the porter, I saw a tall
young fellow, good-looking, but rather flash-looking
too, go past, and in three or four minutes I saw
him ring at the gate of Mr Byrle's house.</p>

<p>'Hollo!' I says to my railway friend, 'isn't that
Sims Reeves? Does he come down here to give
lessons?'</p>

<p>He was no more like Sims Reeves than I am,
but his was the first name I could think of.</p>

<p>'Sims Reeves!' says the porter; 'why that's
young Mr Byrle, as gives his father no end of
trouble. You wouldn't see him there, only the
old gent is off somewhere for a while. He went
from our station last night.'</p>

<p>'Indeed!' I said (and then I saw the young man
go into the house); 'and what's the quarrel about?'</p>

<p>'Oh, his goings on,' said the railway man. 'Why,
I have heard that his father has paid thousands on
his account; and if he hadn't paid one time pretty
heavily too, this young fellow would have been in
Newgate for forging his governor's name. He's
agoing abroad, I believe; and a good riddance too,
I say.'</p>

<p>'And what does he do at the house when his
father is away?' I asked; and I really felt that our
conversation was getting quite interesting.</p>

<p>'Well, it's the old story; a lady's in the case,'
said the porter. 'There's a niece there that's over
head and ears in love with Mr Edmund&mdash;that's his
name&mdash;and he pretends to be equally sweet on
her. But if she had seen only as much of him
as we have seen at this here station, she would
never&mdash;&mdash; There's my foreman agoing into the
shed! Excuse me.' With that the railway-man
finished his pint and was off.</p>

<p>I considered a minute, and then decided I
was as well off where I was as anywhere; so I
borrowed yesterday's <i>Morning Advertiser</i> of the
barmaid, and sitting down where I could watch
the house, pretended to read. If any one had
watched me, he must have thought I was most
remarkably interested in the Money Market, for I
had that part of the paper folded towards me
without changing for a good half-hour. At the
end of that time the door of Mr Byrle's house was
opened and the son came out. I was ready for a
start after him, let him go in which direction he
might; but he came towards the <i>Railway Tavern</i>,
my post; straight on, nearer, nearer he passed my
door. I peeped out after him, and saw him
actually come into the tavern, entering by another
door the compartment of the bar next to mine!</p>

<p>I was in the common place; he was in one of
those divisions where 'Glasses only are served in
this department;' and so on. There was some one
there already, for I had heard the occasional clink
of a spoon and glass, and a cough; but there wasn't
more than one, for I had heard no voices. I
now heard some one speak; I judged it to be
young Mr Byrle, and I was right.</p>

<p>'Hollo, skipper!' he said, 'what have you been
doing to your face? Have you been fighting?'</p>

<p>'Fighting!&mdash;Well, never mind my face; I don't
want to talk about that; I shall settle that
account some day,' said a voice. (<i>I</i> knew what
voice; <i>I</i> knew what was the matter with the man's
face.)</p>

<p>His surly tone seemed to shut young Mr Byrle
up on the subject, for he gave a sort of forced
laugh and said no more about it. 'When do you
sail?&mdash;for certain now. I must know to an hour
to-day, for I don't like what I hear of things,' said
Mr Byrle.</p>

<p>'Don't speak so loud,' said the other; 'you can
never tell who is listening;' and there he was
more thoroughly right than he suspected. However,
they dropped their voices so completely after
this, that though I sat right up against the
partition, I could hear nothing more than a stray
word or so, out of which I could make no sense,
until at last Mr Byrle said: 'Time's about up,
skipper.'</p>

<p>'I suppose so,' said the other. 'Well, you feel
quite confident about her then; her courage won't
fail, you think?'</p>

<p>'<i>Her</i> courage fail? Ha, ha! skipper,' said Mr
Byrle; 'you don't know her, or you wouldn't say
that. She'll come with the material, you'll see.
From first to last she's never wavered; and look
what a penetrating mind she has got!'</p>

<p>'Yes; she's clever, I think,' says the skipper.</p>

<p>'Clever!' Mr Byrle repeated, with a deal of
contempt in his voice&mdash;'clever! Who but her
would have found out the scheme'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Hush!' said the skipper, stopping the young
man, just as his conversation was getting, I may
say, instructive and important. Then Edmund
Byrle said his train was due, and posted off to the
station.</p>

<p>A minute or so after I heard the skipper put
down his glass as though he had emptied it, and
then he too left. I followed at a little distance,
and got into the same train with him, and got out
with him, and still following, saw him go to the
ferry, pick out, as I knew he would, the surly
waterman; and I saw him rowed to his own ship,
where the waterman left him and then rowed over
to the other side. Very good. Then the skipper had
gone to T&mdash;&mdash; specially to meet Edmund Byrle;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">{791}</a></span>
and Edmund Byrle had gone there specially because
his father was away; and&mdash;&mdash; Then I
couldn't follow it up any further.</p>

<p>I went boldly into the <i>Yarmouth Smack</i>, and
not seeing Tilley anywhere about, I asked for him
under the agreed name, and was told he had gone
to work on Byrle's wharf; not for the firm, but
for some lighterman who frequented the public-house.
This looked well; and if I got taken on, as
I expected, the next Monday, I thought it would
be very odd if between us we didn't find something
out. Yet my interest in the business seemed
dying away, or drifting into altogether a new
channel, for I could not believe for a moment
that Miss Doyle and Edmund Byrle, and the
skipper and the sulky ferryman, were all linked
in with stealing a few paltry brass fittings.</p>

<p>I crossed over before the old ferryman came
back, and had my dinner in the tap-room of the
<i>Anchor and Five Mermaids</i>. It wasn't a nice place
for a dinner, and I was always partial to having
my things neat and tidy, which was by no means
the rule at the <i>Anchor</i>, and the company was not
to my standard. I was late to-day, so I missed the
factory hands; and there were only two men in
the room with me; one was a costermongerish-looking
rough in a velveteen coat and fur cap,
which was about all I could see of him, for he was
asleep all of a heap in a corner. The other was a
man who had his dinner in a newspaper, and took
it out, whatever it was, with his fingers, till he had
finished it and then went away.</p>

<p>I was glad when he was gone, and I had the
room as I may say to myself; so I sent my plate
away, called for a little drop of rum-and-water
(the only thing you could get fit to drink at the
<i>Anchor</i>), and lighting my pipe, sat with my feet
on the fender, to have a good smoke and a good
hard think. I had sat there perhaps half-a-dozen
minutes, and had fairly settled down to my thinking,
when a low voice said: 'Mr Nickham!'
My name! It was a very low voice which spoke,
but the roar of an elephant couldn't have startled
me more. In an instant it flashed upon me that
my disguise was seen through and all my plans
understood. Robinson Crusoe was not so staggered
when he saw the foot-print on the sand as I was
on hearing these two familiar words. I turned
round, and there was that miserable-looking
rough that I thought had been asleep, standing
up and making signs to me. He was a regular
rough and no mistake, with short hair, an ugly
handkerchief twisted round his neck; his nose had
been broken at some time or another, and he
looked a complete jail-bird. 'Mr Nickham!'</p>

<p>It was he that spoke; no mistake about it this
time; and he put his hand up to the side of his
mouth to keep the sound straight.</p>

<p>'Who are you?' said I; for you know I didn't
like to answer to the name at once, in case he
wasn't certain.</p>

<p>'My name is Wilkins&mdash;Barney Wilkins,' said
the man. 'But you won't recollect me by that
p'raps; though I've been through your hands,
sergeant; but I giv some other name then. You
got me twelve penn'orth for ringing in shofuls.'
(He meant that he had been sent to prison for
twelve months for passing bad money. I wasn't
surprised to hear it; he looked fit for that or anything
bad. But if he got it through me, why he
should speak to me now was beyond my comprehension.)
'I knowed you directly I see you,
sergeant,' he says, coming nearer, but still speaking
in the same hoarse whisper as at first; 'and though
you're a tight hand, you're fair and square, and
acted as such by me when you copped me. You
are down here on business&mdash;you're after some rare
downy cards. Now ain't you, sergeant?'</p>

<p>'If you know,' I said, 'what do you ask me for?
And if you think I am what you say, you don't
suppose I shall tell you my business, do you?'</p>

<p>'Sergeant,' he says, coming nearer still, 'you
fought a man in the street last night, and giv him
a thorough good licking. You was the only man
there as would take the part of a poor gal as wasn't
doing no harm to nobody; and I respect you for
it, sergeant; I do. That gal was my sister&mdash;my
young sister, as has been like a child to me, and
was so tidy and pretty that I was proud on her,
and hoped&mdash;&mdash; Well, sergeant, whatever we are, we
all have our feelings; and Sergeant Nickham, I'll
do you a good turn. Look here!' With this he
crept quite close and put his mouth almost to my
ear. I watched him carefully, being much puzzled
by his actions, yet I had seen such unexpected
things occur in the police that I was quite ready to
hear something of consequence from him. 'You
are down here about that Bank paper, what is said
to be all got back, but which you know it isn't.
You are on the right parties, and it does you
credit; but you'll never get them nor the paper
without <i>me</i>.'</p>

<p>He stopped here, to see what I would say; but
though I was ten times more surprised than ever,
I kept my countenance, and only said: 'Well?'
In point of fact I didn't know what <i>to</i> say.</p>

<p>'I've been used bad, Mr Nickham,' he went on.
'I've had a lot of trouble and risk about that there
paper. I got it from B&mdash;&mdash;, and took the money
for it to him, honest; and have been as near took
with it in my possession as anythink. Twice the
slops (he meant the police; 'slops' is what we call
'back-slang,' a rough sort of spelling the words
backwards)&mdash;'twice they have come into my place
when the stuff was there. Once I was sitting
upon it done up like bundles of rabbit-skins.
Now he gives me (the party wot I am down on)&mdash;he
gives me five pounds, and I can't get no more
out of him. And you see there ain't no reward
out.'</p>

<p>'No, not regularly, Barney,' I said; 'but there's
no doubt at all that any man coming forward
would be very handsomely considered by the Bank
people.'</p>

<p>'He might be, if he'd got anybody like you to
speak for him,' says Barney. 'But you know, Mr
Nickham, that I am wanted for a lot of things by
the bobbies; and I have been through the mill so
often, that without I've got a friend I don't half
like touching 'em again. But you're fair and
square, and you licked the fellow last night; and
I'm told you can box better than even Tom Sayers
could; and if that's so, I'll trust you. And this
here man won't give me more than five pounds;
and he has settled with a regular fence, a sort of
Dutch-Yankee skipper, what pretends to command
one of them traders out there.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' I said; 'the man I fought last night.
I know him.'</p>

<p>'<i>Him!</i>' almost screeched the man (although,
mind you, he never once forgot his hoarse whisper);
'was it him you licked? Sergeant Nickham, I'd go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">{792}</a></span>
through fire and water for you now, for I hate and
despise that wretch; and if I had got a chance to
do it safely, I'd have'&mdash;&mdash; He checked himself
very sudden here, as if what he was going to say
wasn't exactly the sort of thing to say to a detective.
'I see you are on the right lay,' he begins again;
'but I tell you he has settled with that skipper
to have the stuff put on board, if it ain't already
there; and then he'll go with it to whatever foreign
port the craft comes from.'</p>

<p>'And who is he,' I asked, 'who has arranged
with the skipper?'</p>

<p>'Ah, Mr Nickham,' says Wilkins, with a very
cunning look, 'as if you didn't know! Haven't
you been on the lurk round his house for two days
past? Wasn't you there this morning?'</p>

<p>Egad! I saw it all now! You might have
knocked me down with a feather. I could hardly
help saying something which would have shewed
my astonishment; but I choked it down, and
quite determined to keep the upper hand with
him, I said as cool as I could: 'Now, Wilkins, no
beating about the bush, or making me help you
out. If you've got anything to say, any name to
mention, out with it like a man, and I'm your
friend. You understand me.'</p>

<p>'Fair and square you are, Mr Nickham,' says
Barney; 'and so you'll find me. That young Mr
Byrle has got the paper, and he means to go out
with the trader. There is people over in Holland
awaiting anxious for it; and if once they gets hold
of it, it's all U. P. with our bank-notes. Now, I
don't know where the paper is; if I had known,
bust me if I wouldn't have blowed the gaff long
ago!'</p>

<p>He meant that he would have exposed the
whole transaction, and I noticed that this declaration
did not quite agree with his anxiety to have
a friend on his side, a point on which he had
dwelt so much before; but that didn't signify.</p>

<p>'Now, Mr Nickham,' he went on, 'you must
board the craft when the paper is shipped, if it
ain't there yet.'</p>

<p>'It ain't there yet, my man,' I said, remembering
what had dropped from Edmund Byrle, that
'she would come on board with the material.'</p>

<p>'Then I think it will be to-night,' he continued;
'for a sail-maker as has been at work aboard her
says she drops down the river to-morrow; and
I think by what I can learn in other quarters, he
is right.'</p>

<p>I thought so too, and at once made up my mind
that the meeting at the <i>Railway Tavern</i> was to
settle about shipping the paper.</p>

<p>'I can give a pretty good guess at the man they
will engage for the job,' says Wilkins.</p>

<p>'I know him,' I said; 'a tall, sulky-looking,
bony-headed old fellow, with a game eye.'</p>

<p>'Why, Mr Nickham,' says Wilkins, 'you're a
wonder, a perfect wonder! You're a credit to the
force, and Sir Richard ought to hear of it! Why,
that's the man, the very man; and here have you
only been down two days, and know all about it!
Keep your eye on him after dark, and you're all
right.'</p>

<p>We had some more talk after this; and then he
pretended to go to sleep in his corner again, and
I went out.</p>

<p>I went straight into the City and saw some of
our chief people, who sent over to the Bank.
They would not chance my going there, for fear
of somebody seeing me that had better know
nothing about it. The gents from the Bank could
hardly believe their ears, and the compliments
they paid me, to be sure! It was decided that
everything was to be left in my hands, and I was
provided with letters to the right parties at the
water-side. But I need not go into any further
particulars of that kind.</p>

<p>I was not going to trouble myself any more just
now about the pilfering at Byrle &amp; Co.'s factory;
as far as I was interested in it, the thieves might
take boilers, wheels, chimneys, and all. I took up
my post in the old arbours, and there, though the
rain came steadily down, I sat. I managed to
get a pretty dry corner; and with a little of the
<i>Anchor's</i> rum-and-water and my pipe, I made
myself tolerably comfortable while I sat and
watched the Dutch trader. I was well screened
from the sight of any one below, or else my corner
would not have suited; and although I could hear
the steps and the voices of the people going to the
ferry, and could have touched them by leaning
over, yet they could not see me.</p>

<p>The bony ferryman, in his tarpaulin coat and
hat, was there this afternoon; and very sloppy and
miserable all the boats looked; and as the tide
fell lower and lower, the great broad bed of river-mud
grew broader, and the path to the ferryboat
grew longer, and still I kept my watch, and
meant to keep it. I must own, however, that I did
not expect to see anything worth notice, for what
could there be? But sometimes, you know, in
our business, it is as necessary to watch to make
sure there is nothing being done, as it is to make
sure that some important movement is going on.</p>

<p>There was an oyster-smack not fifty yards from
me as was left on the shingle or mud when the
tide went down; and there was a man smoking
his pipe on the deck of that oyster-smack, just
as I was smoking mine in the arbour; and when
night came, and the river got dark, and you
couldn't make anything out of it but a great black
space, with a hollow sound of the wind moaning
over it and of the water lapping on the shore as
the tide rose again&mdash;then there was a lantern
burning on the deck of that smack, and there was
a similar lantern burning in my arbour; but the
light was shewn open on board of the smack, and
mine was a dark-lantern (so was the other) with
the light hid. But I was perfectly well aware
that the man aboard that smack never took his
eyes off me while it was light, and that after dark
he watched to see if I shewed my lantern. I didn't
shew it; but if I had, there would have been a
Thames police galley and five armed constables
alongside of that hard in a couple of minutes.</p>

<h2><a name="AN_EXTRAORDINARY_PROJECT" id="AN_EXTRAORDINARY_PROJECT">AN EXTRAORDINARY PROJECT.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the city of San Francisco resides Mr Hubert
Howe Bancroft, a gentleman about forty-five years
of age, formerly engaged in commerce, but now
retired from business, in order that he may devote
his whole life, as well as the wealth which he had
amassed, to the furtherance of a project which he
formed some sixteen years ago. This was no less
comprehensive a task than the compilation of a
full history, as well as a scientific account, of all
that vast district west of the Rocky Mountains,
which, stretching from Panama to Alaska, embraces
Central America, Mexico, and California.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">{793}</a></span>
It was to be in a popular form, and to embrace
every point of interest that could be ascertained
respecting the Pacific States, their aboriginal
inhabitants, their successive civilised occupiers,
their geology, botany, and other natural features.
First of all in this stupendous task comes the
history of the native tribes&mdash;to be completed in
five volumes, the first instalments of which are
already published by Messrs Appleton and Co. in
New York, and by Messrs Longmans in our own
country. These will be followed by a history of
the States from the Spanish Conquest down to
contemporary times, and for this portion of the
work it is thought that some twenty volumes will
be required. A third series will treat of the
geological structure of the territory, its minerals
especially, and of mining operations. Physical
geography forms the fourth section of the proposed
work; whilst the fifth will deal with agriculture;
and the sixth with bibliography. It must be
apparent that a man must be of a highly sanguine
temperament to imagine such an enterprise; it
will be well if he live to complete only a portion
of it; and should he really succeed in doing what
he wishes, he will have earned for himself an
honourable distinction, and conferred on the world
an extraordinary boon.</p>

<p>But how was such an undertaking to be begun?
Where were the materials; and even granting that
they were to be procured, how was such a mass of
general reading as must be consulted, to be utilised?
Mr Bancroft's first step was to solve this
difficulty. He decided to establish at his own
cost, in San Francisco, a library of reference, which
should contain all the books to be had for money
which could throw any light on the subject. With
this end in view, he appointed agents in all the
principal cities of the world, whose business was to
frequent sales, examine book catalogues, and effect
the purchase of any volumes which seemed likely
to contain useful information. Of course by such
a system many books were transmitted to headquarters
which ultimately proved to be of little
or no value; but this was inevitable in the course
of purchases of such magnitude. And notwithstanding
all drawbacks of the kind, the collection
has gradually increased, until it is said now
to consist of between eighteen and twenty thousand
volumes, including pamphlets; whether this
number also includes manuscripts, we are unable
to say. The acquisition of these works has been
occasionally furthered by adventitious circumstances.
The Mexican war, for instance, was the
means of throwing in Mr Bancroft's way some
highly valuable documents, which, under favourable
circumstances, would have remained the property
of their lawful owners; these, contained in
four volumes, are a set of parchment records of
the Church in Mexico between the years 1530 and
1583, and apart from their historical value, have
an interest to the bibliopolist as containing autographs
of many celebrated men, amongst others
of Philip II., Torquemada, Las Casas, and Zumarraga,
first Archbishop of Mexico. This last-named
worthy is notorious for his act of insensate bigotry
in destroying the Aztec records, and thereby
depriving the world of the history of that race;
he burned the hieroglyphic paintings of Anahuac
in the public square of Tlatelolco, much as
Ximenes did with eighty thousand Moorish manuscripts
in Granada. These priceless records were
stolen from the government archives! When the
unfortunate Emperor Maximilian's library was
sold, many valuable works were also obtained from
that collection, which had been gathered together
during a lifetime by a well-known amateur, Count
Andrade.</p>

<p>The weakest part of the arrangement of Mr
Bancroft's undertaking is the manner in which the
books are housed, but this is probably an unavoidable
evil; they occupy the fifth story of the
owner's house in Market Street, San Francisco,
where they are exposed to all the risk of fire, to
say nothing of the inconvenience of such a plan.
The apartment in which they are kept occupies the
whole length of the building, and the books are
arranged upon shelves reaching from the floor to
the ceiling, and running from one end of the room
to the other. Let us now see how it is proposed
to utilise this mass of literature for reference.</p>

<p>No one but a resolute enthusiast with an abundance
of means could have brought this extraordinary
project into shape. The trouble spent in
the undertaking has been enormous. Of course,
the projector has a staff of assistants possessing the
requisite accomplishments, headed by a librarian,
Mr Oak, who has been indefatigable in producing
a catalogue of the works collected, with copious
subordinate references. So aided, Mr Bancroft,
as we understand, has begun his literary operations;
but whether he will live to complete
his colossal production in proper artistic style
must necessarily be left to conjecture. Fortunately,
besides being still in middle life, he is said to
have splendid bodily health and great powers of
endurance, both of which must stand him in good
stead. He always writes at a standing desk, and
sometimes prolongs his hours of labour to as many
as eleven or twelve&mdash;which seem to us excessive.
Such application may do for work which is chiefly
compilation; but any brain-worker knows that it
is simply impossible to do really valuable work
throughout such a time. As a matter of fact, very
few men can read or write hard for more than six
hours a day with profitable result. Let us hope,
however, that the man who has had courage to
undertake such a task, will have self-restraint
enough not to endanger its success by an undue
straining of the faculties, which must be kept in
full repair to insure its accomplishment. We
should be sorry to hear that any disaster from
fire had put an abrupt termination to so well-meaning,
though we may be allowed to call it
a somewhat eccentric undertaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> came on towards me, her trailing draperies
falling round her with the soft grace she gave to
all she touched. Sunshine was on her beautiful
hair&mdash;evening sunshine, which turned the wreath
of plaits she wore into a crown of burnished gold.
She came floating on, through the flower and fruit
gemmed orange trees, through the crimson and
pure white camellia bloom; violets grew beneath
her feet, and she seemed to me part of the glory
and the fragrance of the sunset and the blossoms.</p>

<p>Below the terrace where I stood, lay the sea,
where blue faded to green, and green to opal, melting
into one deep far-stretching mystery of purple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">{794}</a></span>
light and banks of golden cloud. Palaces and domes
and tapering spires shone white against the dark
background of distant mountains. Suddenly the
music of many bells rung out on the still air, their
chiming softened by distance into low faint sweetness.
They were the bells of the stately marble
city that shone so fair across her gleaming bay.
The first bell-notes were taken up and echoed by
the bells of chapels in villages along the shore; of
convents hidden away in country dells and valleys,
till the air was full of lingering prayerful sound.
Through it, through the magical Italian twilight
came the woman I loved. She came and stood
beside me, looking across the water to where
Genoa's palaces glimmered against the sky; but I
do not think she saw or thought of them. There
was a dreamy look in her eyes, a cold, set weariness
about her mouth, which is only seen in those
whose thoughts have drifted far from where they
stand.</p>

<p>'Are you tired of this place?' I at length ventured
to ask her.</p>

<p>'Not particularly,' she answered; 'you know I
never care much where I am.' The words sound
petulant; but said as she said them, they were only
weary. I should have been glad if she had ever
shewn impatience; anything rather than the cold
quiet which ever lay upon her beauty like a pall.
At first, in my triumphant happiness at having
won her promise to be my wife, this coldness had
not chilled me&mdash;as it sometimes did now&mdash;to the
heart. I so longed, so hungered for a word of
love, for a tender look. All her stately beauty
would soon be mine, and it seemed still as far
from me as ever.</p>

<p>We leaned on the low parapet of the terrace,
while the music of the bells died away, till only
the slow beating of the waves broke the stillness.
It was an hour of wonderful peace and beauty, yet
a strange sense of unrest took possession of me,
and jarred the music of the waves and the restful
quiet of the twilight. Standing there close to her,
with the certainty that soon she would be my own
for ever, a vague thrill of fear came over me, a
fear lest all this feverish joy of knowing she was
mine, might vanish away, and leave me a lonely
mortal. This love for her had become to me an
all-absorbing passion; and yet she never for one
moment allowed me to think that my love was
returned. Perhaps it was the might of her beauty
that filled my senses; yet I have seen beautiful
women since, and had seen them before I first
saw her on the walls above the old Etruscan
gateway at Perugia.</p>

<p class='p2'>One morning the week before, I had strolled out
from the dull hotel; and leaving the street with
its tall houses and quaint old fountain, glowing
in the day's first freshness, I sauntered on to the
walls, and there I first saw her. Below in the
valley the silvery olive leaves trembled in the
sunshine; wreaths of broad-leaved vines clung to
the gray old trees, clothing them with a borrowed
beauty of youth and freshness. Hundreds of
flowers blushed in the light, and varied odours
from herb and blossom filled the air with a
subtle languor. Above, on the lichen-covered
wall, with a background of purple mountain, a
fitting frame to her stately loveliness, she sat,
looking out across the sunlit land, with the dreary
far-away look in her great deep eyes, and the
haughty coldness upon her chiselled face. I
lingered about, drinking draughts of beauty;
fancying it was my artistic sense that kept me
there watching her face, till she rose wearily, and
slowly walking down the street, entered the hotel
where I was staying.</p>

<p>I found on inquiry that a Mrs Vereker and her
niece, Miss Mayne, had arrived there the previous
evening. I had sometimes met Mrs Vereker in
London; and later on in the day, while I was
carelessly examining the carving on the fountain
in the square I saw her and my vision of the
morning standing on the cathedral steps. Mrs
Vereker came forward with that friendliness we
feel for a slight home acquaintance whom we
may chance to meet when abroad. So I joined
them, and we strolled on chatting over home news.
Miss Mayne seldom spoke, and yet that walk
seemed to me a strangely happy one. Mrs Vereker
told me they had only been a day in Perugia,
and had intended going on at once to Rome;
but the mountain air and mountain views were
so delightful, they had changed their minds, and
intended remaining for some time at Perugia.</p>

<p>I had come to the old town to study art; to
search the blazoned manuscripts lying hidden in
sacristy and convent, and learn from them their
secrets of colour and design; to wander through
frescoed church and palace, where walls and
ceilings are brilliant still as when the hands which
wove their gorgeous stories first laid the pencil
down and thanked God for the great consoler&mdash;Art.
I had come to watch the mists rising from
the valleys, and wrapping the mountains in soft
mystery of cloud&mdash;cloud which changes and shifts,
and melts at last into the golden and purple,
the opaline green of the sunrise; so that I might
try to wrest from Nature a faint touch of her magic
of shadow and light, of colour and form, and lay
it at the feet of the one mistress I had ever known&mdash;Art.</p>

<p>What I was now studying was a woman's
heart&mdash;and what I learned was&mdash;nothing. I
do not think mine is an impressionable nature.
I had spent thirty years in the world, and had
never loved any woman until I saw Mary Mayne
in the morning light sitting above that old gateway;
yet in one short week I had grown to love
her&mdash;well, as few women are ever loved.</p>

<p>At the end of that week came a letter from
Willie Vereker, saying his yacht needed some
repairs, and he would put in at Genoa for a few
days if his mother could meet him there. He had
been to the East, and she had not seen him for some
time; so she decided on going back to Genoa;
hoping the <i>Gwendoline</i> might need more repairing
than Willie thought, and keep him there longer
than he expected. The evening of the day Mrs
Vereker received that letter, I told her of my love
for her niece, and asked permission to accompany
them to Genoa.</p>

<p>She regarded me with an odd look of compassion.
'Have you spoken to Mary yet?' she
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">{795}</a></span></p>

<p>I told her I had not; I wished to wait until we
had known each other longer; I feared being too
precipitate.</p>

<p>'Then,' said Mrs Vereker, 'I have no right to
tell you anything of her story. It is a sad one,
poor child! and I warn you, you have little chance
of success. If you choose, you can come with us
to Genoa; but if I were you, I should not do so.
Save yourself while you can. You have known
her a very short time. If you leave us now, you
will soon forget her; later, you may find it a more
difficult task.'</p>

<p>I shook my head. The advice came too late.
I went with them to Genoa. The stately marble
city had a charm for us all. Mrs Vereker had
her son, and the two found marvellous attractions
in the quaint narrow streets with their palace
portals, their courts and halls, where fountains
sparkled and flung diamonds of spray round the
brows of pure fair statues; where in the coolness
and the shadow, gold-laden orange trees and thick
masses of crimson blossom gleamed with sudden
startling glory.</p>

<p>I had my idol. Day after day I was by her side.
It was a fool's Paradise perhaps; but I suppose
there is such an Eden in every life; and looking
back, when we have left its short-lived peace, we
vainly long for a single throb of its rapture. So,
during those quiet days at Genoa, each of us,
except Mary Mayne, had our heart's desire: Willie,
the life, the colour, the loveliness he and his
<i>Gwendoline</i> sought in voyages to many lands; Mrs
Vereker, her son; I, my new delirious joy. There,
on the terrace where we were standing, I first
spoke to Mary, and heard her tell me my love was
hopeless. She told me her story.</p>

<p>Her wedding-day had been fixed. In a year she
was to have been married to a man she loved with
her whole heart; when the war with Russia broke
out, and Gordon Frazer's regiment was ordered to
the Crimea. He and Mary wished to be married
before he left, but family reasons prevented it, and
so they parted. He had never returned to England.
A soldier brought Mary a little locket which she
had given Gordon. The ribbon it hung upon
was thickened here and there with deep dark
stains; and the man said Gordon Frazer had
given it to him to take to Mary, when the young
officer lay dying after the charge at Balaklava.
It was only the story of many an English and
many a Russian girl during that dreadful time.
When a strong, self-contained nature breaks
down, it is almost utter collapse; so it was with
Mary. For months she lay silent, tearless, listlessly
unable to make the slightest exertion, to
take the smallest interest in life. Her friends
thought her brain had suffered from the shock;
and when she recovered sufficiently to travel, Mrs
Vereker had taken her abroad, where they had
been moving from place to place ever since.
Her body regained health; she was now quite
strong; but the girl's heart and soul seemed dead;
as she said, dead, and buried in Gordon Frazer's
grave. Yet as I listened I did not despair. I
had no living rival; he was dead, this man she
loved; while my heart was beating, living, and
strong with its worship of her. If I could only
win her to be my wife, the dead love would pale
and faint before my real and passionate devotion.
So I hoped, as day by day I watched her every
look, forestalled her every wish, until she grew
accustomed to my presence, and to rely upon my
care. My hopes were answered; ere long I won
her reluctant consent to be my wife, but on the
condition that our marriage should not take place
until their return to England next year.</p>

<p>The rosy clouds were fading into the deep
purple of Italian night. Silence fell around us
as a mantle; only the throb of the sea below the
terrace broke the intense quiet. Out on the sea
shone the white sails of a little yacht. Nearer,
within the harbour, rose the masts and spars of
many ships, mysterious, spectre-like, as ships
always look at night. As we were seated in calm
enjoyment of the scene, a small boat shot out from
the rocks beneath our feet, where lay some hidden
cave or landing-place. It was rowed by two men;
a third sat wrapped in a large cloak in the stern.
They rowed well, and the boat was nearly a mile
from us, leaving a bright line of light upon the
shining water, when a cry broke the calm of the
night&mdash;a wild, weird cry, with agony in its tone.
'Gordon!' I have never heard its like since, and
I hope I never shall again. In its agonised tone
I could scarcely recognise the voice of Mary, so
changed was it, so shrill with long pent-up
yearning, as it wailed out that one word&mdash;'Gordon!'
The cry seemed to be repeated again
and again, though softened by the echoes, while
the little boat sped on its way, and its passengers&mdash;mere
dark specks they seemed&mdash;climbed into
the yacht. The white sails gleamed against the
horizon, and then, phantom-like, were lost in its
dim purple.</p>

<p>I turned and looked at Mary. She stood with
her eyes fixed on the darkness which hid the
yacht from sight, her hands clasped upon her
heart, her face drawn and colourless. I feared the
fate her friends dreaded for her had stricken her
as she stood beside me there in the still luxurious
twilight. 'Mary, my dearest, my own!
what is it?'&mdash;taking her hand and drawing her
closer.</p>

<p>She drew her hand from mine, and shuddering
away from me, leaned against the stone parapet,
resting her head on the cold marble coping.</p>

<p>'You are ill; let me take you home, darling,' I
said.</p>

<p>'No,' she murmured; 'not ill. But oh,' she
exclaimed, 'Harry, Harry! my good kind friend,
help me! <i>Gordon was near us just now.</i> I felt
it; I am sure of it. You will help me to find him;
will you not?'</p>

<p>Help her to find him! help to break my own
heart&mdash;to bruise this new-found sweetness out of
my life! The very thought struck me with a
sudden chill. What if this fancy of hers, coming
so close upon my sure forebodings, should be a
reality? What if Gordon Frazer were still in
existence? I thrust the thought from me as I
should thrust a temptation. 'I will help you in
any way I can, my darling,' I said; 'but come in
now; the night-air is chilling; and you are giving
way to feverish fancies.'</p>

<p>'No,' she said; 'it is no fancy.' Drawing
herself up wearily, she turned without looking at
me; and I followed her down the terrace and
across the marble court of the old palace which
was our home in Genoa. I watched her glide,
stately and pale and quiet, up the broad white
staircase.</p>

<p>It was months before she recovered from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">{796}</a></span>
brain-fever in which she awoke next morning&mdash;such
awful months, during which we often feared
the worst. Yet when they were over, and she was
among us again, paler, more fragile, but still her
own beautiful self, stately, self-possessed as usual, I
was almost thankful for the terrible illness, which
proved that her cry and wild words on the terrace
were but warnings of coming illness, the mere
wandering of a brain diseased.</p>

<p class='p2'>The Roman season was nearly over, yet Rome
was full&mdash;full of English sightseers, like ourselves;
full of Americans, on rapid flight across
Europe; of eastern prelates, in flowing eastern
robes, with olive-hued eastern faces; of eager-faced
French ladies, and solemn-eyed peasants from lonely
villages on the Campagna, and of Italians from city
and from plain; for it was Easter-time. We were
only waiting until the conclusion of the festivities
to set out on our journey home. Home! I never
until now felt half the meaning of that word.
When we got home, Mary and I would be married.
I should give up wandering, and settle down into
a country gentleman. I thought with a pang of
self-reproach of the grand old home which called
me master, shut up in desolate state since my
dear father died. How a fair young mistress
would brighten and beautify the old rooms. I
could see it all now&mdash;the oaken hall with its
quaint old pictures; spring sunshine pouring in
at the open door, red-coated sportsmen grouped
under the beeches, horns ringing from the copses,
children playing under the shadow of the avenue
of limes&mdash;the loveliness of joyous life, where for
so long had been the silence left by death. It
was a sunny dream of home&mdash;home in fair England,
into which I had fallen; standing there,
upon the Pincian, under the deep dark blue of
Roman night.</p>

<p>Below lay the city, its narrow streets dimly
mysterious, no light visible in their tall houses;
the fountain murmured its sweet monotonous
music in the Piazza di Spagna; the wide white
marble steps gleamed along the hillside; tall palm-trees
cast weird shadows across the gravelled walks;
nightingales answered each other in low rich trills
of song, echoing from tree to tree, through whispering
palms and odorous night-flowers. Beside me,
cold and silent, was the woman whose charmful
spell woke within me this new sweet longing
for home&mdash;home musical with the soft rustling
of women's garments; with the tender voices of
little children. I suppose such a dream and such
a longing come to all men at some time of their
lives; it came to me that night as I stood above
the city of vanished glories, of dead and buried
dreams.</p>

<p>It did not last long. Suddenly, above the city
roofs, a cross of silvery light shone out against the
sky. The illumination of Saint Peter's had begun.
Above the winding narrow streets, above palace
roofs, above palm and cypress, above triumphal
arch and mouldering temple, over the palace of
the Cæsars, over Capitol and Forum, the silvery
cross shone glad, triumphant; and from it, the
light spread from window to window, from pillar
to pillar, till the vast pile was one glory, changing
rapidly from soft silvery radiance into a glow of
golden fire.</p>

<p>'It was worth coming to see. Was it not,
Mary?'</p>

<p>'Mary!' A stranger's voice echoed her name;
and instead of answering my question, she sprang
with a low cry from my side, and laid her head
upon a stranger's breast. 'Did you not get my
letters? I have been looking everywhere for you,'
I heard him say.</p>

<p>She did not answer, nor raised her head; as if
at last she had found her rest.</p>

<p>'You are not alone here?' he went on. 'Who
are you with?'</p>

<p>Then with a quiver as of pain, she raised herself,
and looked from me to him with beseeching
eyes and trembling clasped hands.</p>

<p>Before she spoke&mdash;for even in all the agony
of my crushed-out hopes, my love for her bore
down all other feelings, and I tried to save her
from the pain of telling me what I already knew&mdash;I
said: 'You have found an older friend than I
am, Mary. Shall I leave him to take you to Mrs
Vereker?'</p>

<p>'An older friend?' he repeated. 'By Jove! I
should think so.'</p>

<p>Then raising his hat, he shook hands with me
as I turned away.</p>

<p>I turned into the darkness, but not before I had
seen that until now I had never known her, my
love, my promised wife. I had known a beautiful
statue, not the beautiful woman who, with eyes
upraised to his, stood in the subdued light looking
up to Gordon Frazer. All the coldness, all the
stately calm had gone, fallen from her as a mantle
falls&mdash;a mantle which had hidden the fullness of
her loveliness, and had concealed from me a
tender grace and beauty I had never till now
beheld. I have never seen her since.</p>

<p class='p2'>Some time afterwards I met a friend who had
seen a good deal of the Frazers. He was loud in
admiration of Mrs Frazer's beauty and of her
devotion to her husband. 'He was out in the
Crimea, you know, and was reported dead; but
he was only wounded. Some Russian family, to
whose house he had managed to be sent, had
tended him with kindly care after even his own
doctors had given up hope, and had pulled him
through his danger. Mrs Frazer told me,' continued
my friend, 'how one evening when standing
on a terrace at Genoa, she heard his voice;
and thinking it was a reproach from the grave (for
she was going to marry another fellow), she got
brain-fever, and was near dying. The fact was,
the yacht in which a friend had brought him
from Constantinople touched at Genoa, and he had
actually spent the day doing the palaces! When
she heard his voice, he was returning to the
<i>Peri</i>, which lay about two miles from the shore.
Romantic story, isn't it? But Gordon takes her
devotion coolly enough; the love seems more
on her side than on his. I cannot understand
that.'</p>

<p>Understand it? Yes, I could. Hers was one
of those great-souled natures who like to give
rather than to take, to pour out all the wealth and
beauty of their being on the idol which they
have clothed in all the glory of their own imaginings.
God grant she may live on to the end,
happy in her womanly idol-worship!</p>

<p>As for me, the dream I dreamt upon the Pincian
Hill, before the cross of golden light shone over
the city roofs, was never realised. No rustle of
woman's garments makes low music in the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">{797}</a></span>
oak-panelled rooms; no children's voices wake
the echoes under the avenues of arching limes.
The old Devon manor-house stands as yet without
a mistress.</p>

<h2><a name="NARCOTISM" id="NARCOTISM">NARCOTISM.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> these days of medical knowledge, when so
many merciful means for the alleviation of pain
are known, it follows as a matter of course that
great abuse of sleep-producing agents exists. We
would therefore say a few words of caution as to
the pernicious practice of people making use of
chloral, chlorodyne, chloroform, and other kindred
agents <i>without medical advice</i>. It is, we think,
little known to how great an extent this evil
exists. To come across a lady who is constantly
more or less under the influence of chlorodyne,
is by no means uncommon; every trifling ailment
or passing <i>malaise</i> being an excuse for a few drops
of that narcotic. Chloral is also extensively and
improperly used; the more so because, unfortunately
at the time of its first introduction as a
sleep-producing agent, it was most erroneously
stated to be perfectly harmless, and many are still
under this impression.</p>

<p>The real truth is, that <i>no</i> narcotic of any kind
whatever is harmless, but on the contrary, invariably
pernicious when taken otherwise than by the
advice and under the treatment of a medical man.
True, sleeplessness is one of the most trying things
a person can suffer from; but then there are other
means of combating the enemy than by dosing
one's self with chloral or any such agent; and thus
making an infirmity chronic, which would in all
probability have been only a temporary evil. Rely
upon opiates for sleep, and sleep will not come
without them. Thus a bad habit is formed; the
bodily strength is undermined, the digestive powers
enfeebled, the mind and intellect weakened and
enervated, and the unfortunate sufferer becomes a
slave, bound hand and foot to a habit that it is
almost impossible to shake off. Sleeplessness often
comes from want of sufficient fresh air and exercise,
from over-mental work, mental distress, from
too great a quantity of stimulants taken during the
day, and from various other causes, which a little
care as to diet and regimen would quickly overcome.
Taking short naps during the day; too
much tea and coffee drinking, especially shortly
before bedtime&mdash;all these are apt to cause sleeplessness.
In many cases a light and simple supper
taken shortly before retiring to rest, and attention
to the feet being thoroughly warm, will insure a
good night's sleep when more energetic means
have failed.</p>

<p>In those terrible abodes of suffering, our cancer
hospitals, the method of all others most resorted to,
and most efficacious for the alleviation of pain, is
the sub-cutaneous (under-the-skin) injection of
morphia. In sciatica, neuralgia, and other painful
nervous affections, this remedy is often exceedingly
beneficial, when used under competent medical
advice and supervision; but like every other good
thing it is open to great abuse, and often made
use of merely as a soothing narcotic by the irritable,
excitable, and discontented. A long train of
evils follows; but with these we are not called
upon to deal here. What we want now to lay
before the reader is a plain statement as to the
prompt treatment called for in a case of over-narcotism
from too strong a dose of injected
morphia. Coldness of the extremities, lividity
of the countenance, profuse cold sweat, and loss of
power over the limbs, insensibility, very deep
breathing, and contraction of the pupils of the
eyes to such an extent that they resemble a black
pin-head, result.</p>

<p>What then is to be done? Time is precious,
and perhaps half an hour or more may elapse
before medical aid can be obtained. Taking it for
granted that the patient is in a recumbent position,
the first thing to be done is to raise the head, to
sponge the face and chest copiously with fresh
cold water, to rub the limbs steadily and strongly,
to put hot-water applications to the feet and to
the sides of the body, if it feel cold to the touch.
Place strong smelling-salts to the nose; lay the
head on one side with the mouth open, so that
the tongue may not fall back and prevent respiration;
give brandy-and-water, if the patient can
possibly swallow it; but if the narcotism be
severe, this will be impossible, and it is wisest
to abstain from attempts which may result in fluid
going the wrong way. In fact do everything to
keep the body warm and the breathing unimpeded,
and strive to rouse the unconscious faculties into
action.</p>

<p>Supposing, however, that the narcotism be very
excessive, and the breathing be slow, irregular, and
low, then if medical aid be not forthcoming, it
would be well to resort to artificial respiration; by
no means a difficult matter to manage, if only any
one present has a slight amount of knowledge on
the subject. The following is Dr Sylvester's
method, and is advantageous from its simplicity:
'Place the patient on the back, inclined a little
upwards from the feet by raising and supporting
the head on a cushion, placing support
also under the shoulder-blades. Draw out the
tongue and keep it forward, so as to leave the
air-passages free. Remove all clothing from the
neck, chest, and abdomen. Stand by the patient's
head, take firm hold of the arms just above
the elbows, and draw them gently and steadily
upwards above the head, keeping them stretched
upwards for two or three seconds. Then turn
down the arms, and press them firmly and steadily
against the sides of the chest for two or three
seconds. Repeat these movements alternately,
deliberately, and <i>perseveringly</i>, until a spontaneous
effort at respiration is perceived; immediately
upon which, proceed to try by every possible
means to induce circulation and warmth.' However,
should the case of narcotism be <i>not</i> a severe
one, such extreme measures as artificial respiration
will not be called for, and in all probability, after
the use of those simpler remedies at first named,
sickness will occur, and this may be taken as a
sign that the worst of the evil is over.</p>

<p>And here let us once more emphatically state
that in this and all other cases we assume that a
medical man is sent for, and that our suggestions
only refer to what is to be done <i>until</i> he appears
upon the scene. Nothing is so annoying and so
productive of harm as for a non-professional person
to be constantly making this and that suggestion
as to the treatment of a sufferer, when a medical
man is giving his best thought and skill to the
case; but on the other hand it is well for people&mdash;more
especially women&mdash;to know what to do when
thrown upon their own resources.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">{798}</a></span></p>

<p>Cases of poisoning from over-doses of opiates
are of course only one class of such-like accidents;
and the accidental swallowing of irritant poisons,
embrocations, &amp;c. often occur, and call for the
utmost promptitude of action and presence of mind
on the part of those present.</p>

<p>In the less densely populated parts of the country,
it is a positive necessity that people should
be able to rely upon themselves in cases of emergency,
for if a doctor is many miles distant, and it
takes several hours to fetch him, one might almost
as well be without him, where sharp practice is
called for. To produce vomiting, one of the best
emetics we happen to know of is an American one.
It consists of a table-spoonful of common treacle
(molasses it is called across the water) and as
much powdered alum stirred into it as the sticky
compound can be made to contain. Now alum is
such a valuable drug in many ways that it ought
to be kept in every household medicine-chest;
and treacle is not usually hard to get. We have
never seen this remedy tried in a case of poisoning,
but we <i>have</i> seen its effect in croup; and anything
more decided and imperious in its action it
would be difficult to imagine. Such a dose might
freely be given in <i>any</i> case of poisoning; and after
the emetic has acted freely, we would give some
soothing mixture, such as thickened milk. There
are various things which have the power to a
certain extent of protecting the coats of the
stomach from the action of irritant poisons; if the
poison be an acid, the scrapings off a white-washed
wall or chalk and milk are good. Milk almost
stiffened with common brown sugar is one of them;
sweet oil taken to nauseation is another.</p>

<p>In all cases of poisoning, <i>loss of time</i> is the one
great thing to be avoided; and the nearest remedy
at hand is the best one to make use of. Mustard
and water, strong and plenty of it, is a capital
emetic. Of croup, that enemy of juvenile humanity,
we must now speak a few words; and we
know of no better remedy than the American one
above described, combined with a hot bath and a
hot blanket to roll the child well up in afterwards.</p>

<p>The ignorance of the poor as to the treatment
and still more the prevention of the diseases of
children is something appalling, and there can be
no doubt that thousands of little lives are annually
sacrificed to this Moloch.</p>

<p>'I can't tell what ails my child, ma'am,' said a
labourer's wife to the writer of this, one bitter day
last winter, 'he's carrying on so strange: crowing
like a cock, and turning his-self almost black in the
face every nows and again.'</p>

<p>The infant in question was comfortably seated
on a nice cold door-step, and breathing as if he had
swallowed a baby's rattle by mistake. 'Your child
has the croup,' I said, picking up the unfortunate
little creature and carrying it to the fireside; 'and
if you don't do something for him at once, he'll
very likely die.'</p>

<p>However something <i>was</i> done for him, and
he didn't die; but he had a kick for his life all
the same, and very little more door-step would
have finished him. Yet this poor woman was not
an unloving mother; she was only ignorant, and
in her ignorance, assisting her child into the grave
she would have shed such bitter tears over.</p>

<p>From croup to diphtheria is a natural progression,
and we would wish to say a few, a very few
words on this terrible disease; not as to its treatment
by the amateur nurse, for it is of the greatest
importance that such cases should have close
medical care. It is then on the subject of the
operation called <i>tracheotomy</i>&mdash;that is, the making an
outward incision in the windpipe below the seat of
the disease, and inserting a tube for the purpose of
respiration, that we would speak&mdash;not to discuss it
in its medical aspect, but simply to say a word or
two to nervous mothers who would shrink from
the idea of the surgeon's knife touching a sick
child under any circumstances whatever. Surely
there can be no more pitiful sight to look upon
than a child dying of diphtheria&mdash;the eyes wild
with fear, looking appealingly for help from one
troubled face to another; the little hand thrust
into the mouth in helpless, useless effort to dislodge
the terrible leather-like substance that is
clogging up the throat, and making each breath a
sound so painful that for days and weeks to come
it will not cease to sound in our ears. What more
agonising sight can the sick-room give us to gaze
upon? And yet doctors have told us of cases in
which a mother has had such an overpowering dread
of the surgeon's knife, that even when things come
to such a state as this, she has positively refused to
allow of any attempt at alleviation of her child's
agony by a simple operation!</p>

<p>Now it is on this head we wish to say a few words
of encouragement and counsel. Tracheotomy is
in the first place a <i>chance</i>&mdash;a very slight chance in
most cases&mdash;but still a chance for life; but if it
does not save life, it spares the child a death of
awful suffering. The pain of the operation itself
is so momentary as not to be worth considering,
and relief is <i>instantaneous</i>. We are not speaking
of recovery, but simply of the difference between
such a death as that described above and
the quiet 'falling asleep' of the child upon whom
tracheotomy has been performed; and this is what
the writer saw&mdash;the frightened appealing eyes; the
pitiful effort at self-help; and then the instant
relief given by firm and skilful hands; and four-and-twenty
hours later, the quiet painless death;
the boy smiling up into our faces as the pure spirit
fled to that place of rest and peace where 'there
shall be no more pain.' It was not a thing to be
seen and forgotten.</p>

<h2><a name="LIFE_IN_A_MILITARY_PRISON" id="LIFE_IN_A_MILITARY_PRISON">LIFE IN A MILITARY PRISON.</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>BY A PRISON CHAPLAIN.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> an address lately delivered at Birmingham,
Professor Tyndall says: 'I met some few years
since in a railway carriage the governor of one of our
largest prisons. He was evidently an observant
and reflective man. He told me that the prisoners
in his charge might be divided into three classes.
The first class consisted of persons who ought
never to have been in prison. External accident,
and not internal taint, had brought them within
the grasp of the law, and what had happened to
them might happen to most of us. They were
essentially men of sound moral stamina, though
wearing the prison garb. Then came the largest
class, formed of individuals possessing no strong
bias moral or immoral, plastic to the touch of circumstances,
which would mould them into either
good or evil members of society. Thirdly came a
class&mdash;happily not a large one&mdash;whom no kindness
could conciliate and no discipline tame. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">{799}</a></span>
were sent into this world labelled "Incorrigible,"
wickedness being stamped as it were upon their
organisations.'</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, there is a distinction made,
and rightly made, between the inmates of military
prisons. They are divided into first, second, and
third classes; which you may call bad, worse,
and worst, if you are of the despairing type of
philanthropist; or good, better, and best, if you
are a great believer in human nature, even in
imprisoned human nature. The first class wear
a red stripe on the arm, and being the best
conducted, are given less work to do and more
food. Class number two are marked with a yellow
stripe; while the third or lowest class are distinguished
by a white badge. A stranger might perhaps
shrink from all who wear white stripes as
from 'incorrigibles;' but some in the third class
may be really very little more 'incorrigible' than
himself, for every prisoner, no matter what his
character may be, except in very special cases, is
placed in the third class on his reception. He
then, by good conduct, becomes eligible for promotion
into the second class, and subsequently into the
first. Rule one hundred and sixty-six of the Regulations
for Military Prisons, lays down that 'the
first class will be composed of those prisoners who,
from their quiet orderly habits and general good
conduct under punishment, may appear deserving
of being promoted from the second class after
some experience has been gained of their characters.
Prisoners in either the first or the second
class will also be liable to be removed to a lower
class for misconduct.' Though the first class of
prisoners are employed during the same hours as
those prescribed for the second class, the labour is
of a less severe description: picking oakum or
drill being substituted for the deservedly hated
crank and shot exercise. Another privilege enjoyed
by the first class is, that they are never
deprived of their bed, whereas, 'all prisoners on
reception are to sleep for the first week in the
same manner as a soldier on guard&mdash;that is, on a
board without undressing&mdash;and subsequently, the
third-class prisoners are to sleep as on guard
every other night; and the second-class prisoners
in the same manner every third night: the prisoners
of the first class being alone exempted from
this rule.' First and second class prisoners are
employed in this prison&mdash;which is no Castle of
Indolence&mdash;at drill, shot exercise, the crank,
cleaning the passages and other parts of the premises
from six o'clock <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to six o'clock <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>; and
those of the third class from six o'clock <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to
eight o'clock <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>; with the exception of regular
times for parades, chapel, and meals.</p>

<p>'If any man will not work neither let him eat,'
is a motto strictly adhered to by the authorities;
for no prisoner is allowed meat-dinner who is not
employed at hard labour. Those not so engaged
are only given porridge and bread-and-milk.
When labouring at hard work, prisoners have a
meat-dinner every Tuesday and Thursday. Eight
ounces of beef without bone and one pint of soup
is the allowance. The first class have an additional
meat-dinner on Sundays. There is, we see, considerable
advantage to be gained by the prisoner,
to reward his ambition, should it prompt him to
move upward into a higher class. Now this is
no trifling matter, for the very essence of good
prison discipline is the subordination of mere
punishment to reformation; and this system
of classification tends not only to preserve a
man's self-respect, but to fan the spark of hope
that otherwise might be extinguished in his
breast.</p>

<p>The justly celebrated novel <i>Never too late to
Mend</i> has made the public in some degree familiar
with the 'silent system' of prison discipline. This
system has been found not to work when sentences
are for a long period. Speech is discovered to be
more than a luxury, being essential to the mental
health of prisoners. None now are condemned
to the silent system except those who are imprisoned
for only a short time. And how great is
the punishment of not being allowed to speak, is
proved to the chaplain by this one fact. Nowhere
are prayers so diligently responded to and
hymns sung with such <i>will</i>, if without musical
taste, as in the chapel of a military prison, for
prisoners recognise the service as an opportunity
of convincing themselves that they have not
become dumb. Until this explanation was given
by the governor, I was full of admiration for
religion, afterwards discovered to be more loud-sounding
than genuine.</p>

<p>Prisoners condemned to solitary confinement
are forced to turn to the wall on the approach
of visitors or the superior officers of the prison.
'Has my face assumed any terrific aspect? Am
I so much worse-looking than usual?' This is
the thought that naturally comes into one's mind
on walking through a military prison for the first
time. Each man takes a quick glance at your
Gorgon head, and then, fast as lightning, turns his
back to you and his face to the wall, until your
apparently baneful or bewitching influence has
passed.</p>

<p>Another humiliation to which prisoners have
to submit is that of having their hair frequently
cut short. A man must sink very low indeed
before he lose altogether personal vanity. It
would seem as if there were a peacock as well as
an angel and a beast in each of us. For this
reason the regulation that requires the hair of all
prisoners of the third class to be cropped every
fortnight is no slight punishment. It is especially
felt by those who leave the prison without having
been promoted to the second and first classes, in
which a prisoner's hair is permitted to grow during
the last fortnight of imprisonment. How can a
man shew himself in respectable society, or take
off his hat to a lady, when that common act of
courtesy would reveal the fact that his hair was
cut by&mdash;government?</p>

<p>Some may desire to know whether flogging has or
has not been entirely abolished. To the question,
we answer: 'Yes; except for aggravated breaches
of prison discipline.' Nor is it easy to see in what
other way such cases can be dealt with. A man,
let us suppose in a fit of sulky stubbornness, does
not attempt to pick his oakum. He is brought
before the governor, and sentenced to lose his
supper and bed; that is, to be obliged to sleep on
the floor. On going back to his cell he says to
himself: 'What can I do now to avenge myself on
the authorities?' and he acts on the impulse that
seizes him, which is to break the window and
destroy everything in his cell. Probably this sort
of stubborn ill-conditioned character is a coward;
and if this be the case, nothing is found to bring
him to his senses so well as twenty-five lashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800">{800}</a></span>
administered in the presence of the governor and
medical officer.</p>

<p>The punishments which we should like to see
abolished, if others without equal or greater disadvantages
could be discovered, are the crank and
shot-drill. 'What is the crank?' may be asked by
happy people who have never had to do with
prisons in any way. It is, we answer, a Sisyphus'
wheel that the prisoner is forced to turn twelve
or fourteen thousand times each day, for no other
reason than because the useless monotonous exercise
is sufficiently hateful to him to be a real
punishment. 'To what purpose is this waste?' we
may ask. Why is this wheel not made to pump
water or grind corn or do some other useful work?
Why should a man be degraded into a machine,
and made to turn a wheel merely for the sake of
turning it? Will he not in this way lose all self-respect?
Yes; these are the unanswerable arguments
against the crank. But then its very uselessness
is urged as an argument for its retention.
Suppose, for instance, that prisoners are employed
in gardens where vegetables are cultivated for
barrack-use, what will be the consequence? That
soldiers will desire to abandon their own profession
for Adam's calling, and for this purpose will
designedly get into prison. If, again, the crank-wheel
be utilised in any way, men will feel that
they are useful members of society, and will probably
prefer their new work to the dull routine
and irksome duties of barrack-life. Almost the
same remarks are applicable to shot-drill, or the
very humiliating process of lifting six times each
minute for three hours per diem a thirty-six
pound cannon-ball, for no other reason than to
put it down again three paces from where it
originally lay. Nothing can be more fatiguing
and worrying than this process of putting the
shot there and back, there and back, there and
back! But then we must again remark, that to
make prisons very comfortable is absolutely to
make them useless.</p>

<p>Almost all the inmates of military prisons are
sentenced for such crimes as these: Desertion&mdash;the
commonest crime of all&mdash;making away with
kit, breaking out of barracks, insubordination.
How is desertion to be stopped? This is now a
very difficult problem with the authorities, and
almost all officers give it as their opinion that the
plague of desertion can only be stayed by again
having recourse to the system lately abolished of
branding the letter D on the deserter's side. In
the absence of this <i>Nota bene</i>, there is nothing to
prevent a soldier from enlisting over and over
again in different corps, in order to get a bounty
and new kit on each occasion.</p>

<p>As regards insubordination, when you speak to a
prisoner on the folly of having resisted or disobeyed
a non-commissioned officer, he will generally give
an answer somewhat as follows: 'Well, sir, when
I came back from foreign service I had a little
money, and with this I drank with some comrades
more than was good for me. There is a corporal
[or sergeant] in the barrack-room who is always
down on me; and upon that day, having had a
little too much, I could not stand his going on at
me; and so I&mdash;though indeed I tried to help myself
doing so&mdash;just struck him between his eyes.'
There is no doubt that nine out of every ten
soldiers in military prisons have got into trouble
through drink. A soldier was once overheard
describing the advantages of the Cape as a station
in these words: 'Drink is cheap, and you are
always dry.' Men of this stamp fill our military
prisons.</p>

<p>In some cases the crime of insubordination is
provoked by the petty bullying and offensive
manner of non-commissioned officers, though their
superiors do their best to check them. Officers
are now easily accessible, and are ready to give
the youngest private an impartial hearing. In
all respects the position of a British soldier is
now greatly improved. Indeed it is not too much
to say that life in a military prison now is quite as
endurable as was existence out of it to the well-conducted
soldier of forty years ago.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
